          <h1>Strawberries </h1>
          <p>Strawberries are one of the easiest fruit to grow and great for beginners.The best thing about strawberries is that they’re very easy to grow in almost all climates and soils.
            Fertilize with all-purpose granules for strong growth. Water adequately, about one inch per square foot per week.Mulch mulched strawberry beds to reduce water needs and weed invasion.
             Row covers are a good option for protecting blossoms and fruit from birds.
